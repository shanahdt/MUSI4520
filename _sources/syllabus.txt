Course Objectives
=================

This course looks at the piano prelude in the late 19th- and early 20th-century 
from many different angles. We will study the various compositional techniques 
employed by composers such as Chopin, Liszt, Rachmaninoff, Scriabin, and Debussy, 
and we will use selected sets of preludes as a way of examining aspects of 
chromaticism, “impressionism”, music-theoretical discourse, and performance practice. 
This course will explore the repertoire in depth and provide the students with 
the tools for engaging with music that frequently eludes discussion.

In this course you will: 

- Learn about the various approaches to discussing the standalone piano prelude
- Understand the historical and cultural contexts within which these pieces were composed
- Engage in the analytical discourse of the 20th century surrounding the genre

Resources
=========


There is no text for this class. Articles, scores, and 
scanned book chapters will be made available on Collab.

Website
--------

I will be sticking with Collab for supplemental readings, quizzes, and 
assignments this semester. This Syllabus is on Collab, and I will be 
adding content (recordings, links, articles, etc.) 
to the Collab site on a daily basis.

Policies and Grading
=====================

It is very easy for this topic to become overwhelming if one is not 
accustomed to working with it on a regular basis. In order to avoid falling behind, 
you are expected to come to all class meetings, and return all written assignments 
promptly.

**There will be frequent assignments (including question sheets, 
analyses, and reading responses), and one final project this semester.**

Assigments and tests will receive numerical grades (100 = perfect).

The breakdown of grades for this class is as follows:

- Assignments (40%)
- Attendance/Participation (30%)
- Final Project (20%)
- In-Class Presentation (10%)



Classwork, Homework, and Grading
-------------------------------------------------

Assignments are due at the beginning of class. Late assignments 
will be docked 5 points according to the number of days (24-hour timespans) 
from the official due date. For example, if you hand in an assignment that would normally receive an
88 within 24 hours of the class, it will be reduced to an 83.  

Presentations
--------------------
 
Each of you will be paired with another classmate to present your homework 
once on one of the Mondays during the semester, starting on January 27th. 
In addition to the copy of the homework that you hand in to me, 
you are responsible for making a copy for every other member of 
the class, so make sure to leave enough time to make copies
for your presentation.

Begin your presentation by asking the class a series of questions that 
will get them to think about the assignment and explain how they approached it. 
You will then distribute your own solutions, explain them, and solicit responses. 
You should plan for your presentation to take only 10 minutes, but follow-up questions
are likely to go on for a bit longer.
Your oral presentation counts as one homework grade, separate from the grade 
you receive on the homework itself. Try to present as well as possible: be prepared, 
be strategic about the way you use your audio-visual aids (slideshows, if preferred), 
speak loudly and clearly, and use the appropriate terminology. 

I am happy to meet with you beforehand to go over your presentation.
Before meeting with me and certainly before presenting in class, 
you should also convene with your partner, 
discuss the assignment together, and plan out the presentation.

You can see a rubric of how presentations on Collab.


Late Assignments
------------------

Assignments must be submitted at the beginning on class, either on Collab or by paper
(depending on the assignment). Late assignments will be deducted 5 points per class. For example,
an assignment due on Monday that earns a 94 will be awarded an 89 if handed in before Wednesday, 
an 84 if handed in before Friday, etc.
**ASSIGNMENTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED AT ALL AFTER TWO WEEKS**. 

Attendance and Tardiness
---------------------------

Attendance is required, and is an extremely large part of your grade.  
Sign-in sheets will be handed out at the beginning of each class, 
and will be collected within the first 10-15 minutes of class. 
If you are unable to sign in, it will be treated the same as an absence.

You may miss at most two classes with no deduction, unless 
you have a written excuse from a health care provider or another 
authorized excuse as arranged with the teacher.  
Consistent unexcused absences (more than 2) will lead 
to a 5 point deduction in your attendance and 
participation grade.

Assistance
-----------
I am available and interested in talking with you about the course,
the course material, and strategies to enhance your learning. 
We can usually have brief discussions after class, and I am able to 
answer questions by e-mail (dts9h@virginia.edu) at any time. Please feel free to visit 
me during office hours (see above) at any point during the semester. Additionally, I am happy to set up an
appointment at a time that is mutually acceptable for more lengthy
discussions.

Final Project is Due Wednesday April 30th by 5pm.

Final Paper
============= 

Your final, 10- to 12-page paper will be due at 5pm on Wednesday, April, 30th.
I will meet with each of you individually during the week of Monday, March 31st,
to discuss possible paper topics. Sign-up will be on Collab the previous week.
Please come to our session with at least two possibilities in mind. You are
also required to submit a 1-page, single-spaced outline and a 1-page,
single-spaced bibliography by the beginning of class on April 14th.
I expect to find at least **6** distinct and substantial sources in your
bibliography. (A wikipedia article is not a substantial source, nor is a blog.)
Be succinct in your outline and judicious in your choice of sources
for your bibliography. Since research methods and materials are specific
to the topic you choose, we will strategize about them
during our individual meetings.

Honor
=======
I trust every student in this course to comply with all of the provisions of the UVA honor system. 
I will ask that you pledge and sign the quizzes, the exam, and all assignments.  
Your signature on the exams affirms you have not received nor given aid while 
taking your exams, nor accessed any notes, study outlines, old exams, answer keys, 
or books  while taking an exam and that you have not obtained any answers from another 
student's exam.  Your signature on the papers affirms that they represent your original 
work, and that any sources you have quoted, paraphrased, or used extensively in preparing 
the paper have been properly credited in the footnotes or bibliography.

Students with disabilities
==========================

This syllabus is available in alternative formats (PDF, HTML, epub) 
upon request. In addition, if you may need an accommodation based on 
the impact of a disability, you should contact me immediately.

Services.
